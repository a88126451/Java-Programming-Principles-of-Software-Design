# Java Programming Principles of Software-Design

This course is offered at Coursera and is part of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

This is the forth course of the Specialization, [Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-design-principles).

**Notice:** Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. 
The IDE from the University website is [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

# MiniProject in the Course
- [**sortEarthquakeData**]([https://github.com/a88126451/Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software/blob/main/Week%204/MiniProject_babyNames/BabyBirths.java](https://github.com/a88126451/Java-Programming-Principles-of-Software-Design/tree/main/Week2/2.%20Sorting%20at%20Scale)) : 
build a program that analyzes and sorts earthquake data.
- [**makeIversionBatch**]([https://github.com/a88126451/Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software/blob/main/Week%204/HonorsContent_makeGrayBatch/BatchInversions.java](https://github.com/a88126451/Java-Programming-Principles-of-Software-Design/tree/main/Week3/2.%20Word%20N-Grams/WordGramClass)) : 
developed a predictive text generator.

# Course Purpose
1. Use sorting appropriately in solving problems
2. Develop classes that implement the Comparable interface
3. Use timing data to analyze empirical performance
4. Break problems into multiple classes, each with their own methods
5. Determine if a class from the Java API can be used in solving a particular problem
6. Implement programming solutions using multiple approaches and recognize tradeoffs
7. Use object-oriented concepts including interfaces and abstract classes when developing programs
8. Appropriately hide implementation decisions so they are not visible in public methods
9. Recognize the limitations of algorithms and Java programs in solving problems.
10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms including exception-handling, static methods, java.net, and java.io packages.
